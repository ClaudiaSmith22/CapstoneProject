Abstract 

Over time, large scale financial systems made up of firms with common interests and investments become a tangled network of shared assets and overlapping portfolios. Although an investment strategy of diversified assets often is associated with financial security and reduced risk of loss, this strategy inevitably causes the investing firms to be increasingly dependent on one another. More specifically, these firms become much more dependent on the success and/or failure of one another, as a failing firm drives the market value prices of assets shared by other firms down. This negative price impact then causes the stability of other firms to be negatively impacted as well.

Within this project, we created a model that displayed the phenomenon of price impact and interdependent firms. Specifically, firms selling assets at a calculated proportion will result in capital ratios (total capital divided by illiquid assets) being maintained at a given threshold value. Then, we used this model to test the effects of varying portfolio degrees of diversification on the final stability of the system. Using these results, we were able to provide insight into the portfolio diversification measurements that provide the most stability for a financial network.



Diversification used to initialize portfolios.
Method 2 is not completed for multi bank system. Method one uses derviatives to update the capital ratios of the system with each iteration
